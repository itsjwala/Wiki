**marabuzo pattern**

**bullish** open = low , close = high

go long and buy 

**bearish** open = high, close = low

short sell the trade

**spin top - uncertainty**

---

**real body is thick , lower and higher shadow are almost equal**

Bulls want to make market up, and bears want to take market down and due to this uncertainty **open and close are near** 

---

**doji pattern - uncertainty**

**open = close (real body is very thin*, lower and higher shadow are almost equal)**

similar to spin top pattern market is unpredictable right now. 

--- 

**paper umbrella pattern**

**real body** ( **lower shadow = |open - close| * (2|3)** )

---

**hammer - bearish trend before | Bullish trend ahead** 

after a downward trend if a paper umbrella pattern arrives which means bulls don't want to drop the price further and price will go in upward trend

---

**hanging man - bullish trend before | Bearish trend ahead** 

after a upward trend if an paper umbrella pattern arrives which means bears are in action now to take the price down. **short sell** 

---

**shooting star pattern**

**bearish -** real body * 2 = upper shadow

bears want to bring the price down

**p1 -**  red candle day

**p2 -** open lower than previous close showing bears are in control 

suddenly Bulls come in control and starts pushing to newer highs and days close with green candle 

**buy -** close of p2, **stop loss** -  lowest of p1 and p2

---

**2. bearish engulfing**
